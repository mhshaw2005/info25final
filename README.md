## Main Idea
We will be takeing data from each park about how many visitors each park has gotten over the years. We will use this data to show which parks are the most popular, which parks are the least popular, as well as showing the effect that covid had on national park visitors. We will use the location of each parks, and the size of each park to compare how size and location effect visitors.

## Data
Our data consists of the name of the national park, the coordinates, the number of visitors per certain years, and the ID. Our cleaned data has gotten rid of parks that are missing any of these pieces of data. Our number of visitors was origonally flaots, so we made them into integers to make them easier to work with. We also made sure the parks had the same amount of years availible for the visitor count.
