## Main Idea
We will be takeing data from each park about how many visitors each park has gotten over the years. We will use this data to show which parks are the most popular, which parks are the least popular, as well as showing the effect that covid had on national park visitors. We will use the location of each parks, and the size of each park to compare how size and location effect visitors.

## Data
Our data consists of the name of the national park, the coordinates, the number of visitors per certain years, and the ID. Our cleaned data has gotten rid of parks that are missing any of these pieces of data. Our number of visitors was origonally flaots, so we made them into integers to make them easier to work with. We also made sure the parks had the same amount of years availible for the visitor count.

These three plots show the total number of visitors at individual National Parks/Reserves in one year. When saving these images, the names of the National Parks are cut off which renders them basically unreadable. Because the same parks didn't report their visitor numbers in all three years, I was unable to code an order for the parks to appear on the x-axis. For these two reasons, these plots were left out of the final presentation, until McKenna (me) accidentally got stuck on them during the question period. 
These plots do have some interesting information. Many parks had very little change in their visitor numbers between 2019 and 2020. Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Crater Lake National Park, Everglades National Park, Bryce Canyon, and Dry Tortugas National Park, all had noteably more visitors in 2020 than 2019. Conagree National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, and Biscayne National Park all had noteably fewer visitors in 2020 than 2021. In 2021, the visitor count for Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which had been somewhat constant between 2019-2020, skyrocketed along with the Everglades National Park attendence. 
Further investigation into the conditions of each park in each year and the visitor count for each park in each year would be needed to determine if the COVID-19 pandemic caused lower/higher visitor attendence to each National Park.
